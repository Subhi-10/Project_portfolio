##  Projects

### IEEE_Project
- **GAN Based Artifact Restoration** (Python)  
  Achieved 90% accuracy in restoring damaged archaeological images using a custom hybrid GAN framework with edge prediction.

- **SupplyChainBot: Multi-Agent Pathfinding** (MATLAB)  
  Developed a pathfinding algorithm combining genetic algorithms and heuristic methods for dynamic supply chain environments.

- **AI-Based Word Game** (Python)  
  Developed a word pathfinding game using A* and Dijkstra’s algorithms for dynamic gameplay.

- **ML-Based Word Puzzle Game** (Python, Unity)  
  Created story-based puzzle game with LLM-based content generation and interactive narrative.

- **IEEE GenLIFE – Generative AI-Based Affordable Solutions for Transforming Rural Healthcare**  
  Focused on EEG-based Parkinson’s diagnosis using GANs, CNNs and LLMs.

### Gait Estimation Project
- **A Deep Learning Approach to Accurate Human Gait Estimation and Monitoring** (Python)  
  Developed CNN, RNN, and LSTM models for estimating gait parameters including knee joint angles, stride length, and walking speed from IMU-based gait data.  
  Dataset was collected in collaboration with the **Ministry of Defence** and is not publicly available due to confidentiality.  
  Repository includes preprocessing scripts, model training pipelines, and visualization of results.
